A app that tracks the level of "closedness" of your eyes and plays an alert if the value gets too low.
the app identifyes the user with the help of Haar-Cascade in openCV by training the face detector to recognise my face.
Then using dlib to identify landmarks assosated with the eyes. using shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat for this, unfortunatley it's
too big to upload but can be downloaded at
https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat

The app then calculates the EAR value or eye aspect rato by getting the realtionship between the width and height between the points.
if this value falls below 0.3 for more than 7 frames (to avoid false positives because of blinking) it sounds an alarm. It then resets
in order not to play the alarm continuously.
